# Omnivore JSON to Raindrop.io CSV Converter

This is a command-line Python script for converting JSON files exported from [Omnivore](https://docs.omnivore.app/using/exporting.html) to CSV format, making them compatible with [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/). Omnivore is scheduled to shut down soon, so this tool helps users easily migrate their data.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: Ensure that you have Python 3 installed. You can check your Python version by running:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

## Features

- Converts Omnivore JSON exports to a CSV file.
- Compatible with UTF-8 encoding, so text data displays correctly.
- Processes multiple JSON files based on a filename pattern, allowing batch conversion.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `convert.py` script.
2. Place the script in a directory where your exported JSON files from Omnivore are located.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script and your Omnivore JSON files.
2. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 convert.py "metadata_*.json"
   ```
   Replace `metadata_*.json` with the actual pattern matching your JSON files if needed.

### Output

- The script will generate a CSV file named `metadata.csv` in the same directory.
- This file can be imported into Raindrop.io or other applications that accept CSV imports.

## CSV Structure

The output CSV file includes the following columns:

| Column    | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| url       | The URL associated with the item  |
| title     | The title of the item             |
| tags      | Comma-separated tags              |
| note      | Notes or description              |
| created   | The creation date of the item     |

## Example

Hereâ€™s how to use the script for multiple JSON files matching the pattern `metadata_*.json`:

```bash
python3 convert.py "metadata_*.json"
```

Upon successful completion, you should see a message indicating the total number of records processed and that `metadata.csv` has been created.

## Error Handling

- If a JSON file cannot be processed (for example, if it is corrupted), an error message will be displayed, and the script will continue processing the remaining files.

## Notes

- Ensure that all Omnivore export files are saved in UTF-8 format to avoid encoding issues.
- Open `metadata.csv` with a UTF-8 compatible editor, such as Excel or LibreOffice, to ensure proper display of special characters.
